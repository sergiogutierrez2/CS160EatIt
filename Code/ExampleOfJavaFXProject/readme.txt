Upon First Run, 
please navigate to Sign Up Page 
and enter new credentials and press Register.

Once, on the home page, please note that the
Restart button must be pressed in order to update
the Reminders and Highlights located above the
Task Table.

The Data Chart only holds onto the current week's
data and then refreshes when the following Monday
arrives.

The data chart unit is in Hours, so a few seconds
is only ~0.001 hour(s).

The Tasks stay in the task table until deleted by user.
